Next Technical Task\n**Implement core task management endpoints**\n- Build `/task create`, `/task list`, `/task complete` slash commands\n- Set up basic SQLite database with tasks table (id, title, assignee, status, created_at)\n- Create webhook handler for Slack interactions\n- Deploy minimal working version to get first user feedback\n\n### 2. Blocking Progress\n**Missing MVP scope definition**\n- No clear feature boundaries defined\n- Unclear which task management features are essential vs nice-to-have\n- **Action**: Define 3-5 core features max for MVP validation\n\n### 3. Technical Debt\n**Premature complexity risks**\n- Avoid over-engineering database schema\n- Don't build user management until you have users\n- Skip complex integrations (calendars, notifications) until validated\n- **Debt to watch**: Building features before proving product-market fit\n\n### 4. Architecture Assessment\n**Perfect for current scale (0 customers)**\n- Simple Node.js/Python + SQLite + Heroku/Railway deployment\n- Slack SDK + basic REST API\n- No microservices, no complex infrastructure needed\n- Can handle 100+ users easily\n\n### 5. Automation Priorities\n1. **Deploy pipeline**: GitHub Actions for auto-deploy on merge\n2. **Basic monitoring**: Health check endpoint + uptime monitoring\n3. **Slack app distribution**: Automated app manifest for easy installs\n\n### Immediate Next Steps (This Week)\n1. Define MVP scope (max 5 features)\n2. Set up basic Slack app with one working command\n3. Deploy to staging environment\n4. Get first 3 beta users testing\n\nFocus on speed to feedback, not perfect code."

We're burning cash with zero revenue.\n\n**Key Risks:**\n- 296-month runway is misleading - we need revenue validation NOW\n- Building without customer feedback = potential product-market fit failure\n- Zero traction after 4 cycles suggests fundamental issues\n\n**Thomas (COO) Next Actions:**\n1. **TODAY**: Reach out to 10 Slack workspaces personally - offer free 30-day trial\n2. **This week**: Get 3 teams actively using the bot daily\n3. **Next week**: Convert at least 1 to paid (even at discount)\n\n**Strategy Change:** \nYES. Stop building, start selling. Switch to \"sell-then-build\" approach. Get paying customers using a basic version, then iterate based on their feedback.\n\n**Critical Metrics This Week:**\n- Active trial users (target: 3+)\n- Daily bot interactions (target: 20+)\n- Customer feedback quality score\n- Pipeline conversations started\n\n**Bottom Line:** We're in validation hell. Either prove people will pay for this in 2 weeks or pivot hard.",
