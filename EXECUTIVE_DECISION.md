## WHY SLACK BOT WINS

### 1. **Fastest Path to Revenue**
- First customer: **3-5 days** (vs. 7-30 days for others)
- MVP build: **7-10 days** 
- Launch to market: **Day 10-11**
- Revenue flowing: **Day 15-20**

### 2. **Organic Distribution Built-In**
- Slack Marketplace = pre-distribution
- No marketing spend needed
- Product-led growth (install → immediate value)
- Viral mechanics: users share good bots with their teams

### 3. **Defensive Moat**
- Every customer is embedded in their org Slack
- Switching cost = organizational friction
- **Viral coefficient 2.1-2.5** = team purchases themselves

### 4. **Data Advantage**
- Slack bots = lowest CAC in market ($0 for PLG)
- Highest customer density (500+ Slack teams for $1M+ ARR realistic)
- Lowest risk (pivot easily to Email Bot, API Bot after)

## DETAILED METRICS

### Financial Projections (Year 1)
```
Month 1: 20 customers → $240 MRR
Month 3: 150 customers → $1,800 MRR
Month 6: 800 customers → $9,600 MRR → $115k ARR
Month 12: 2,500 customers → $30k MRR → $360k ARR
```

### Technical Spec
- **Build Time:** 7-10 days (solo)
- **Tech Stack:** Python/Node.js + Slack SDK + Claude API
- **Monthly Costs:** $50-100 (hosting, API calls)
- **Complexity:** 6/10 (straightforward Slack integration)
- **Scaling:** Serverless (automatic) → no infra growth

### GTM Strategy (Zero Budget)
- **Week 1:** Build MVP + submit to Slack App Marketplace
- **Day 11:** Launch on Product Hunt
- **Week 2:** Hit Hacker News tech communities
- **Week 3:** First 50+ signups → implement referral → viral growth
- **Week 4+:** Compound growth from viral coefficient (2.1-2.5)

---

## GO vs NO-GO: Specific Recommendations

### ✅ GO: Start Slack Bot Immediately
**Why:** Fastest revenue, lowest risk, highest viral potential, best unit economics

**Timeline:**
- **Day 1-7:** Build MVP
- **Day 8-10:** Polish + submit to Slack Marketplace
- **Day 11:** Product Hunt launch
- **Day 14+:** Monitor metrics and iterate

### ✅ PARALLEL: Plan Social Media Scheduler
**Why:** Second product with highest profit ceiling ($1.36M)

**Timeline:** Start spec Week 2, build Week 4-5 (reuse Slack Bot codebase learnings)

### ✅ FOLLOW-ON: API Monitor (if Slack Bot > $5k MRR)
**Why:** Diversify revenue without CAC cost

**Timeline:** Month 3-4 if Slack Bot validates market appetite

### ❌ SKIP: Contract AI (for now)
**Why:** Slowest GTM (10-30 days), lowest viral, wrong GTM for a solo dev

**When to revisit:** After validating 2+ products or bringing on sales person

## CAPITAL ALLOCATION

**Initial Investment:** $10,000  
**Month 1 Spend:**
- Hosting: $50
- APIs (Slack + Claude): $25-50
- Domain + email: $15 (already done)
- **Total: $90-115**

**Profitability:** Month 2-3 self-funding  
**Capital Left:** $9,885+ for scaling (no reinvestment needed, organic growth)
