## 🚀 RECOMMENDED STRATEGY

### Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): Build & Launch Slack Bot
**Why:** Fastest path to revenue, highest viral coefficient, easiest product-led growth

**Launch Channels (in priority order):**
1. Slack App Marketplace (Day 3-5)
2. Product Hunt (Day 7)
3. Indie Hackers (Day 7)
4. Developer communities (Day 7)

**Expected Outcome:** 50-100 signups by Day 7, 5-8% conversion to paid = $2-5k MRR potential in weeks 2-3

---

### Phase 2 (Weeks 4-8): Parallel Launch API Monitoring
**Why:** While Slack Bot scales, validate second product using same channels

**Launch Channels:**
1. Hacker News (submit early morning)
2. Product Hunt
3. Dev communities overlap

**Why This Works:** Same audience, same content angle, shared marketing learnings

---

### Phase 3 (Weeks 8-12): Email Assistant
**Why:** Diversify into different customer segments, proven organic channels

---

### Phase 4+ (Weeks 12+): Avoid Contract AI Initially
**Why:** Risk-averse market, lower viral coefficient, slower GTM

**Better approach:** Build Contract AI after:
- $5k MRR from products 1-3
- Proven SaaS GTM playbook
- Legal tech partnerships identified

## 📊 Success Metrics (Week 1)

**Slack Bot Targets:**
- ≥ 50 free tier signups = SUCCESS

- ≥ 2.0 viral coefficient = ON TRACK

**Red Flags (if not hitting):**
- < 20 signups by Day 7 = Product/positioning issue

## 🎯 GO/NO-GO DECISION MATRIX

### Questions to Answer Week 1:

1. **Slack Bot gets ≥50 signups by Day 7?**
   - YES → Continue Phase 2 (API Monitoring)
   - NO → Pivot positioning or reduce scope

2. **Product Hunt in Top 10?**
   - YES → Viral potential confirmed, scale
   - NO → Rebuild distribution strategy

3. **Paid signups by Day 14?**
   - YES → Product-led growth working
   - NO → Freemium model may need adjustment

4. **Community engagement strong?**
   - YES → Continue organic channels
   - NO → Identify specific communities that work

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Building too much** → Start with 1 feature (MVP)
2. **Launching everywhere** → Focus on 1 channel deeply
3. **No content plan** → Write blog post BEFORE launch
4. **Ignoring feedback** → Day 1 comments = precious data
5. **Giving up early** → Week 1 = validation only, not success
6. **Spreading thin** → Finish Slack Bot before starting API Monitor
