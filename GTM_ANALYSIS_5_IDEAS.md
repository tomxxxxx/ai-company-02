## STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### Priority 1: Build Slack Bot
- Highest probability of success
- Fastest validation of product-led approach
- Revenue can fund next project
- Natural stepping stone to other B2B tools

### Priority 2: API Monitoring
- Build while Slack bot scales
- Different audience (developers vs. teams)
- Same organic channels work (HN, PH, dev communities)
- Can share marketing learnings with Slack Bot

### Priority 3: Email Assistant
- Strong backup option
- Multiple customer segments reduce risk
- Can launch after traction with #1-2

### Avoid (For Now): Contract AI
- Save for after $MRR validation
- Recommend pivoting to legal tech later
- Focus on fast-moving, tech-forward markets first

## Why Traditional GTM Fails Solopreneurs (& What Works Instead)

❌ **What Doesn't Work:**
- Sales teams (you're not a salesman)
- Paid ads (expensive, no budget)
- Cold email (low response, high friction)
- Enterprise software (long sales cycles)

✅ **What DOES Work:**
- Build in public (distribute while building)
- Product-first (freemium encourages word-of-mouth)
- Choose distribution pre-launch (Slack Bot → Marketplace, API Mon → HN)
- Content teaching (blog/video = passive marketing)
- Community presence (daily engagement = awareness)
- One channel at a time (depth > breadth)

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Choose Slack Bot or API Monitoring as launch priority
2. Spend Week 1 building MVP only
3. Week 2 execute 50% of launch plan
4. Week 3-4 iterate based on data, don't spread thin
