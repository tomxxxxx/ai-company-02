"""
Autonomous Loop — The core engine of AI Automation Lab.

This module implements a continuous, self-improving iteration loop
that runs the company autonomously through 6 layers:

1. Leitebene  — Creative thinking, system reflection, ideas management
2. Strategieebene  — Strategic direction for the iteration
3. Planungsebene   — Concrete action plans
4. Delegationsebene — Prepare execution (agents, tools, interactions)
5. Ausführungsebene — Execute the plan
6. Evaluationsebene — Evaluate results

The loop runs continuously until a blocking Thomas-task is created.
