## 1. Objective

TaskMaster listed and discoverable in the Slack App Directory.

---

## 2. Context

Only anonymous distribution channel available. Without App Directory listing, EXP-001 has no path to users (personal outreach is a constraint violation). All submission content is already prepared in `SLACK_DIRECTORY_SUBMISSION.md`.

---

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] App Icon uploaded (512x512 PNG)
- [ ] All Manage Distribution checklist items green
- [ ] App submitted for Slack review
- [ ] Confirmation email received from Slack

## 4. Scope & Constraints

**In Scope:**
- Upload icon
- Fill in submission form (copy from SLACK_DIRECTORY_SUBMISSION.md)

**Out of Scope:**
- Code changes (done in TICKET-001)
- Marketing after listing

**Constraints:**
- Slack review takes 1–3 weeks (out of our control)
- Thomas must do this manually (~20 min)

## 5. Approach

Follow `SLACK_DIRECTORY_SUBMISSION.md` step by step.
